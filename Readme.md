**Objective:** To learn how to contribute to a GitHub repository by adding your name and GitHub profile link to this list.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Fork this repository:** Click the "Fork" button in the top right corner of this page. This will create a copy of this repository in your own GitHub account.
2.  **Clone your forked repository:** Open your terminal or Git Bash and run the following command, replacing `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git)
    ```

    (Replace `YOUR_REPO_NAME` with the name of your repository)
3.  **Navigate to the repository directory:**

    ```bash
    cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
    ```

4.  **Open the `README.md` file:** Use a text editor (like VS Code, Notepad++, or even a simple text editor) to open the `README.md` file.
5.  **Add your name and GitHub profile link to the list:** Add your information to the "Attendee List" section below, following the format: `- [Your Name](GitHub Profile Link)`.
6.  **Save the changes.**
7.  **Commit your changes:** In your terminal, run the following commands:

    ```bash
    git add README.md
    git commit -m "Add my name and GitHub profile to the attendee list"
    ```

8.  **Push your changes to your forked repository:**

    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```

9.  **Create a Pull Request:** Go to your forked repository on GitHub. You should see a "Compare & pull request" button. Click it.
10. **Write a brief description:** In the pull request description, you can simply write "Adding my name and GitHub profile to the attendee list."
11. **Click "Create pull request."**

I will then review your pull request and merge it, adding your name and GitHub profile link to the official list!
